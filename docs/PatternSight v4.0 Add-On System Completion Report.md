- **Tier-Based Subscriptions:** The subscription tiers were updated to support the new add-on system, with clear information on which add-ons are included in each tier and how to purchase them separately.
- **Updated UI:** The pricing page was redesigned to accommodate the new add-on marketplace and provide a clear, user-friendly experience for selecting subscription tiers and add-ons.
- **Build Fixes:** All JSX syntax errors and build issues were resolved, and the local build process now completes successfully.




## 3. Backend Updates

The backend was significantly enhanced to support the new add-on system, with updates to the Supabase database schema and edge functions:

- **Database Schema:** A new migration was created to add the following tables and updates to the database schema:
    - `addons`: Stores information about the three new add-on packages.
    - `user_addons`: Tracks user subscriptions to the add-on packages.
    - `subscription_plans`: Updated to reflect the new tier-based subscription system.
    - `profiles`: Updated to support the new subscription tiers and add-on system.
- **Edge Functions:** The `generate-prediction` edge function was updated to:
    - Check for active user add-ons.
    - Apply the appropriate enhancements based on the user's active add-ons.
    - Return the enhanced prediction results with add-on information.
- **Add-On Integration:** The edge function now seamlessly integrates with the new add-on system, providing a flexible and scalable architecture for future enhancements.




## 4. Conclusion

The PatternSight v4.0 platform has been successfully updated with the new add-on system, providing users with a more flexible and powerful lottery prediction experience. The frontend and backend have been fully integrated to support the new tier-based subscription model with the three specialized AI enhancement add-ons. The system is now ready for deployment to Vercel.
