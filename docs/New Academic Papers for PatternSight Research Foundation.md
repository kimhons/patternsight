## Paper 1: Bayesian Inference for Stochastic Predictions of Non-Gaussian Systems

**Authors:** Yunjin Tong  
**Publication:** arXiv:2406.18606 [stat.AP] (2024)  
**Journal:** Statistics > Applications  
**Impact Level:** High Impact  

### Abstract Summary:
This research addresses the complexities of non-Gaussian systems by proposing a Bayesian framework utilizing the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) for stochastic predictions. The study evaluates these methods with real-world data under varying conditions including measurement noise, sample sizes, and observed/hidden variables.

### Key Findings:
- Bayesian frameworks effectively handle non-Gaussian stochastic systems
- UKF, EnKF, and UPF provide robust prediction capabilities
- Method selection is more crucial than simply increasing data volume
- Addresses information barriers and curse of dimensionality issues
- Provides insights into prediction variability and measurement noise quantification
